Yes, you are **absolutely correct**! You understand the structure perfectly. Let me confirm:

## The Structure:

```
Google Ads Side                    Your System Side
---------------                    ----------------
MCC (Manager Account)              [Just a container, not in DB]
  ├── Customer Account 1    →      ad_accounts (account_id: 123...)
  ├── Customer Account 2    →      ad_accounts (account_id: 456...)
  └── Customer Account 3    →      ad_accounts (account_id: 789...)
                                           ↑
                                   All linked to users table
                                   via user_id
```

## How it maps:

1. **Google Ads MCC** = Just an umbrella (not stored in your system)
   - Only used for API access with `loginCustomerId`
   - Creates and manages sub-accounts

2. **Google Ads Customer Accounts** = Your `ad_accounts` records
   - Each "customer" in Google Ads = one row in `ad_accounts`
   - Linked to your users via `user_id`

3. **Your Users** = Can have multiple Google Ads accounts
   - One user → many ad_accounts
   - Each ad_account → one Google Ads customer account

## Example:
```
Your User (John, user_id: 31)
  ├── ad_account 1 (account_id: 1234567890) → Google Ads Customer 1234567890
  ├── ad_account 2 (account_id: 2345678901) → Google Ads Customer 2345678901
  └── ad_account 3 (account_id: 3456789012) → Google Ads Customer 3456789012

All these Google Ads customers are under your MCC
```

So yes, you're 100% correct:
- MCC is just a container/umbrella in Google Ads
- Each Google Ads "customer" under MCC = one `ad_account` in your system
- Your users can have multiple ad_accounts (multiple Google Ads customers)
